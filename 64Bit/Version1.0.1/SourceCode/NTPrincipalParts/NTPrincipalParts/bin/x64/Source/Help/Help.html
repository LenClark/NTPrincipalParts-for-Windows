    <h3><a id="mozTocId957724" class="mozTocH3"></a>1. What is it? </h3>
    <p>The Greek verb system is quite complex. Like English (and most modern
      languages), it has a number of <em>tenses</em>. The student (or, indeed,
      experienced reader) has to be able to identify which tense is being used
      by the word he or she is currently reading and understand the possible
      nuances introduced with that verb in that tense. Many of the tenses are
      common in modern European languages: present, imperfect, perfect and
      future. There is an additional tense that isn't found in modern languages:
      the aorist. Traditionally this has been understood as referring to
      completed past actions (while other past tenses have additional nuances).
      However, over the years there have been volumes written on the topic and a
      great deal of debate about just how much this is true. </p>
    <p>But the complexity doesn't end with the aorist. Like all languages it has
      structures that don't simply function as the verb in action (the
      indicative) but provide additional significance: imperative and indicative
      <em>moods</em>. As in many European languages, one of the additional moods
      in Greek is the subjunctive. This is sometimes a problem for English
      speakers because the subjunctive has almost completely disappeared from
      the language. Even where it <em>is</em> used in modern languages, its use
      in ancient Greek was arguably more widespread and consistent. </p>
    <p>In addition to this, there are some examples of the optative. This is a
      mystery to most modern language speakers but, thankfully, had almost
      disappeared from use by the time of the New Testament and is generally
      restricted to set phrases.</p>
    <p>The participle is something Greek has in common with all European
      languages but, in Greek, it is particularly complex.</p>
    <p>Having said all this, there is a yet more demanding complexity: the <em>voice</em>.
      Anything you say in the active voice can be mirrored by the passive voice
      and the same edifice of tenses and moods has its own rules in the passive
      voice. But, what causes most confusion is that Greek has a third voice:
      the middle voice. There is copious debate about exactly how we should
      understand this voice. To add fuel to the fire, many verbs in the middle
      voice look and feel like normal active verbs and there are even verbs that
      are not found in the active voice but function wholly in the middle form.</p>
    <p>So, why have we given this summary? When we learn any Greek verb we are
      encouraged to learn six key forms, known as <em>Principal Parts</em>. The
      idea is that for all except a very small number of exceptionally irregular
      verbs, knowing these six forms allows you to recreate the whole structure
      of the verb (known as a <em>Paradigm</em>). We'll take an example from <em><strong>A
          Catalogue of Greek Verbs ...</strong></em><strong> by James Skerret
        Baird [London, 1880]</strong>. </p>

    <p>(I know! There are seven columns in this table. Baird structured the
      principal parts differently. Also, he covered the entire Classical
      literature while we are only interested in the New Testament - with some
      acknowledgement of the Septuagint.) </p>
    <p>There is also a practical problem with lists of principal parts when they
      are provided in grammars: they are ideals. In order to provide didactic
      value, they often invent word forms which are not found in our literature.
      NTPrincipal Parts provides selected analysis of verbs found in the New
      Testament but will only show forms that are actually used (in our source
      text, anyway). To provide a somewhat wider view, we have also included
      forms used in the Septuagint (LXX) but we have marked words <em>only</em>
      found in the LXX in red italics. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId637853" class="mozTocH3"></a>2. The main window</h3>
    <p>When you start NTPrincipalParts, after a short period where it
      initialises itself and asks you to be patient, you will be faced with a
      fairly busy, small window:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="01_Main_Screen.JPG" alt="Main Window" height="505"
        width="713" /></p>
    <p>This is made up of four areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A word list (left)</li>
      <li>A Summary of six principal parts plus the frequency of use in the New
        Testament </li>
      <li>An extremely simple and simplified Greek "keyboard"</li>
      <li>A display option near the bottom right </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's explain each of these areas:</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId284847" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.1 The Word List</h4>
    <p>The list, by default, will contain all the verbs used in the New
      Testament. We'll explain what you do with this list when we come to the
      virtual keyboard.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId357159" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.2 Grammatical Categories</h4>
    <p>This simply lists the six principal parts plus frequency of use. To make
      its use clearer, let's show a screenshot of a verb that is used more than
      once:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="02%20A%20more%20useful%20verb.JPG" alt="A more useful verb"
        height="505" width="713" /> </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId772301" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.3 The "keyboard"</h4>
    <p>(We're putting the word, keyboard, in quotes because it barely qualifies
      as a keyboard but it is a way of easily entering Greek characters without
      you having to install a second keyboard on your PC.)</p>
    <p>Because the word lists <em>are</em> every verb in the NT, you will often
      want to narrow the list down. This "keyboard" allows you to do that.</p>
    <p>Suppose, for example, that you want to investigate the use of &#955;&#965;&#960;&#941;&#969;. To
      reduce the size of the list, we can type the letter &#955;:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="03_Selecting_l.JPG" alt="Selecting l" height="505"
        width="713" /></p>
    <p>Well, that helped but it's still a sizable list, so let's add &#965;:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="04_Selecting_lu.JPG" height="509" width="717" /></p>
    <p>Now the list is a manageable size and we can easily select the word we're
      interested in.</p>
    <p>Note also that we can keep track of what we've typed in the text below
      the "keyboard". If we press the <strong>clear</strong> button or change
      the grammatical category, the buffer containing our pre-selection text
      will be cleared and we will see the full list once again.</p>
    <p>At this point we need to comment on some aspects of the Summary that
      keen-eyed readers may have noticed. The obvious comment is that some parts
      are left blank. This means that no examples of that part of the verb's
      paradigm was found. The words being reported actually occur in the text;
      if nothing occurs under that heading, then nothing can be reported.</p>
    <p>Note also that the form reported is often not first person singular
      indicative. For example, the image for &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969; shows the
      "Present/Imperfect" part as &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, the infinitive. This is because
      this is the nearest form to its dictionary form that is actually used in
      either the NT or the LXX. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId519116" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.4 Order Entries </h4>
    <p>The last element of the form that needs explanation is the group of three
      options called "Order entries". This will simply change the order in which
      verbs are displayed in the list of available words. The second and third
      options relate to the final entry in the <strong>Summary of the word</strong>:
      the frequency of use of the word in the New Testament. You can experiment
      with this to get the idea: it doesn't actually change anything. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId453460" class="mozTocH3"></a>3. The Detail Screen </h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId450487" class="mozTocH4"></a>3.1 The main elements </h4>
    <p>The <strong>Summary of the word</strong> provides a real-world list of
      principal parts. It will normally be useful to see a more detailed usage
      of the verb and you can get this by clicking on the <strong>View Details</strong>
      button. This will display a comprehensive breakdown of the verb currently
      being summarised:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="05_The_verb_of_interest.jpg" alt="The verb of interest"
        height="509" width="717" /> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="06_verb_example.JPG" alt="Verb example" height="742"
        width="1105" /></p>
    <p>As you might expect from something called a detail, this form is much
      busier than the main form and will require some explanation.</p>
    <p>Note that we have six tabs at the top representing each of the principal
      parts. For the time being we will stay with the first tab, giving all the
      uses of the verb that relate to the present (and imperfect) in all voices.
    </p>
    <p>Note the options in the bottom panel near the right. By default, the
      options are set to avoiding participles, Subjunctive and Optative. If you
      change any of these options, the effects will be displayed immediately.
      (You will probably need to scroll down to see all the entries.) Once you
      have changed an option, that will remain in effect until you change it
      again. The application will also remember you last settings when you close
      the application.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="07_Details_With_More_Options.jpg" alt="Details with more options"
        height="742" width="1105" /></p>
    <p>Click on the different tabs and you will see comparable information for
      the other principal parts.</p>
    <p>Note that, under the first tab, some entries are in "normal" print and
      others are in a lighter, grey colour (and in italics). If you select the
      third tab you will also see that some entries are in red italics:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="08_Aorist_Active_and_Middle.jpg" alt="Aorist active and middle"
        height="742" width="1105" /> </p>
    <p>The different colours are indicators of the roll played by the LXX as
      well as the NT. (Just in case you need reminding when using the utility,
      there is a "key" in the bottom panel.) The colours of the following
      significance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the word is in normal font, that specific form of the word is only
        found in the NT;</li>
      <li>If the word is in grey italics, the specific form is not used in the
        NT (only in the LXX);</li>
      <li>If the word is in red italics, it is found in that form in both NT and
        LXX. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note, however, that some of the possibilities are blank. This means that
      not used in either NT or LXX, so it doesn't occur in our analysis.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId986868" class="mozTocH4"></a>3.2 Saving the information
      to file </h4>
    <p>You can select one, several or all principal parts to save. When you do,
      the file is saved as a tab-delimited file in the same form as the detail
      form. (In fact, it will save a separate file for each principal part that
      you select.) To activate the save, click on <strong>Save to File</strong>.
      You only need to do this once for all tabs on the form.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId345796" class="mozTocH3"></a>4. Wait! There's more</h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId222698" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.1 References</h4>
    <p>If you select a specific form of the analysed word and double click on
      it, you will be provided with a list of all the occurrences of that form
      in the New Testament.</p>
    <p>For example, we select (double click) &#7952;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#951;&#963;&#945; (in the third tab) , we get
      the following dialog: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="09_References.JPG" alt="Refs kept" height="537"
        width="673" /></p>
    <p>You can also arrive at the same point by highlighting the word of
      interest and then clicking on the button: <strong>Display Details for
        Selected Item</strong>. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId816625" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.2 Saving the References</h4>
    <p>In exactly the same way as before, you can save this list as a
      tab-delimited file. Click on the <strong>Save as CSV</strong> button.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId959654" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.3 Closing the Window </h4>
    <p>We haven't really discussed the various close buttons - because they
      normally do exactly what you would expect. However, we are so far down the
      tree of activity that we have provided a means of closing all the windows
      back to the first window: clicking on <strong>Back to base</strong> will
      do exactly that.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId95881" class="mozTocH3"></a>5. One step more</h3>
    <p>If you highlight a particular chapter and then click on the <strong>Display</strong>
      button, NTPrincipalParts will open one more window with the text of the
      whole chapter:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="10_A_Chapter.JPG" alt="A Chapter" height="558" width="1022" /></p>
    <p>You can resize this window to suit.</p>
    <p>Note that all verses that contain the specific form of your selected word
      are displayed in bold text. You also have the <strong>Back to base</strong>
      option at this level.</p>
    <p>As before, you can navigate to this point by double clicking on the
      reference whose chapter you want to see. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId538454" class="mozTocH3"></a>6. Multiple Windows</h3>
    <p>At all levels (other than the base window) you can return to earlier
      windows without closing the latest window and you can open a second,
      third, etc. window:</p>
    <p>This has been provided deliberately so that you can easily make
      comparisons across categories. Be aware, though, that clicking on <strong>Back
        to base</strong> will:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>not close any windows you have opened for other words;</li>
      <li>if you click on this on references after you have opened a chapter
        display, it will not close the chapter display.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId829684" class="mozTocH3"></a>7. Credits and Concluding
      Comments</h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId244290" class="mozTocH4"></a>7.1 Where has the data come
      from - credits, etc.</h4>
    <p>The application is provided for free use. This can only be done because
      so much is now available in the public domain. But that doesn't mean that
      we can simply ignore the efforts that have gone into producing the data in
      usable form or even, in some instances, the intellectual property
      contained in the data.</p>
    <p>The Greek text of the New Testament that is used here is derived from
      text that (I understand) is ultimately traced back to CCAT (The Center for
      Computer Analysis of Texts) at Pennsylvania University - although this
      itself was based on efforts of a number of pioneers (see the article at <a
        href="https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=246"
        target="_blank">https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=246</a>
      for example). More directly, it seems to have been the responsibility of
      SBL ( which is still copyright of the Society of Biblical Literature - see
      <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org" target="_blank">http://www.sbl-site.org</a>)
      although, as far as I can see, it is essentially Westcott &amp; Hort.
      Although I find it morally doubtful to claim copyright on the Greek text
      of the New Testament (as opposed, for example, to critical appendices and
      textual analysis), I am happy to acknowledge the enormous amount of work
      done over the years. </p>
    <p>As implied by some of these comments, so many variations in presentation
      now exist on the internet that it is difficult to be precise about where
      some of it has come from and what path it has taken. A practical
      implication is that<strong> it doesn't do away with your need to use an
        up-to-date version that represents modern scholarship</strong>: you will
      find some words used in the text are now considered, at best, less likely
      variants. </p>
    <p>One further name that needs to be mentioned is James Tauber. He has done
      an amazing job in providing a well-constructed parsed version that has
      been invaluable. You can see some details at <a href="http://jtauber.com/new_testament_greek/"
        target="_blank">http://jtauber.com/new_testament_greek</a> and you can
      learn more of him and his work from there. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId236171" class="mozTocH4"></a>8.2 A caveat </h4>
    <p>In developing the application, we have identified some errors in the
      parsing of words in the LXX data. It was only a handful of words but there
      are likely to be other errors that did not show up in our analysis. Be
      aware that there may be such errors and make independent checks when
      basing decisions on this analysis. Our aim is to make the process of
      learning Greek and using the language more straightforward, but there is
      never a replacement for consulting good texts, lexicons commentaries and
      other source materials. </p>
    <p>So, if you encounter any problems or wanmt to let us know about any
      errors you discover, please contact us at the email address below:</p>

    <p>I studied Physics at London University (Bedford College - alas, no more),
      Biblical Studies at Manchester University and Theology at Oxford
      University. I have had a love affair with computers since my physics
      studies in 1968 and, more specifically, started working on Biblical texts
      and the computer at Manchester in 1979, when working for an MA. I've spent
      several years recently developing this and some related applications in an
      attempt to make the most of publically available information. </p>
    <p>This software <em>is</em> free. I'm too lazy to put together a properly
      formed licence agreement but the usual open source stuff applies, limited
      only by any claims by originators of source data. </p>
    <p>I hope you find this useful. </p>
